                <h3>About me</h3>
                <p>
                I am a UCI 2018 graduate and has been in the software industry as a full stack devloper for over 3 years. I have fulfilled many successful roles within my current and previous companies, from large multi-team projects to smaller projects, where Iâ€™m equally successful designing and developing in an independent capacity. Some of my responsibility has include mentoring new engineers, designing new features for existing infrastructure in a test-driven environment or helping support multiple projects across teams.				
                Outside of my work, I love to latin dance and travel for snowboarding.
